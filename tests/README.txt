PHP Unit Testing Framework
--------------------------

This is a light weight PHP Unit Testing Framework for testing PHP classes on the
command line. It provides a straight forward mechanism for implementing the test
cases and if produces a report in either XML, ASCII of XHTML.

Since you can perform the tests from the command line you are able to implement
a mechanism to perform regression testing thus giving you confidence in your 
latest builds.

Please could you send me any comments or suggestions to ed.heal@yahoo.co.uk. I 
would be most grateful.
